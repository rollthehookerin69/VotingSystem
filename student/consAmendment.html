		<h1 style="text-align: center;">Constitutional Amendment to allow pets in University Residence Halls</h1>
		<p>This Constitutional Amendment pertains to Article 7 section 3 which it would overide.</p>
		<p>The section presently reads: <br/><b>Due to concerns with allergies and living in close quarters with animals no pets will be allowed in Morgantown University Residence Halls</b></p>
		<p>It would be replaced by:</p>
		<p><b>Pets will be allowed in the Residence Halls under the following conditions:
			<ul>
				<li>All other tenants of the room agree to the presence of the pet in writing</li>
				<li>A $20 fee is paid monthly by the pet owner to offset costs to the University resulting from the presence of a pet</li>
			</ul>
		</b></p>
